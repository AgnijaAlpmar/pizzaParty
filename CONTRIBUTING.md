# Contribute

## Join the Party
This repository serves as a sandbox environment that teaches students the basics of git and GitHub. 
You can contribute by taking part in the lesson, and trying to add your own pizza to the party. 
[For instructions on how to get started with this, just check out our Wiki page](https://github.com/WoutDLN/pizzaParty/wiki).
When I notice that you have completed the lesson and submitted your pizza / pull request, I'll accept your request.
That way, your contribution will be incorporated into this repository, and you'll be credited in its version history.

## Improve the lesson
If you are a teacher (or student) who has some ideas on how this lesson could be improved, or how the sandbox environment should be restructured, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/WoutDLN/pizzaParty/issues), or to have a go at it yourself and send me a pull request. I'm open to suggestions.
